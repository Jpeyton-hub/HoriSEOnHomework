># Week one Homework!!
---
## This repo contains the refactored code for a project given to our class cohort by a fictional digital marketing company called Horiseon.
---
We were supplied with the original code and asked to make changes to it in the interest of making it more accessible and orderly. I was made a number of alterations that are accounted for closely in the commit messages and as you can see it did not change the websites actual appearance.

>### Overview of Changes

- changed several of the html wraps to semantic html for ease of use

- re ordered the CSS to have global attributes at the top, then work down the page in coordination with their corresponding elements

- corrected the anchors so that the links in the nav section became functional

- added meta data to the head so as to improve search engine optimization score

- added alt id's to images for accessibility
